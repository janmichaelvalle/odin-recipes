  <h3>Crispy deep-fried pork chops are the stars of this savory Japanese-style rice bowl.</h3>

  <p>Katsudon is a Japanese pork cutlet rice bowl made with tonkatsu, eggs, and sautéed onions simmered in a sweet and savory sauce. It's a one-bowl wonder and true comfort food! Donburi (or rice bowls) are one of the giants of Japanese cuisine.</p>
